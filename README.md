# 🚗 car_price_prediction
🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to predict the price of a car based on various factors such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and other features. This helps in estimating the fair value of a car before buying or selling.

🛠️ Steps Performed

📂 Data Collection & Loading – Imported dataset of car details.

🧹 Data Preprocessing – Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized data.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized key insights and correlations between features and car price.

🤖 Model Building – Applied machine learning models to predict car price.

📈 Model Evaluation – Checked accuracy and performance using metrics (R², MAE, RMSE).

🔧 Tools & Technologies

🐍 Python

📓 Jupyter Notebook

📊 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🤖 Scikit-learn

🏆 Outcome

✅ Successfully built a machine learning model that can predict car prices with 91% accuracy.
📌 The model can be used for price estimation in used car marketplaces and automobile businesses.
